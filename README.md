# ALZ-BYE-MER
A personalized health app that will monitor the user's Alzheimer's Disease risk level and provide recommendations and cognitive exercises.

### Mission Statement

The app will focus on Alzheimer's Prevention.
In the past, those diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease have been told that all they can do is wait for a pharmaceutical cure.  However, promising research shows that one can reduce their risk of Alzheimer’s and dementia through simple lifestyle changes. 

### Application Objectives

Our target users are those who are candidates with pre-Alzheimer's symptoms or those who are worried about Alzheimer's Disease due to age.  People who wish to improve their memory would also want to use this app.

Our system provides our target audience with mental challenges, making them recall past events.  We will keep track of the results of these memory challenges and display detailed statistics to monitor the degree of their Alzheimer's symptoms.  We can send users notifications for taking medications at a specified time, and track their location if needed.

Users would want the results and statistics of their memory challenges to track their Alzheimer's symptoms.  They would also want suggestions of mental and physical activities they can do depending on their current stage of the disease in order to reduce its severity. The app will also provide the users with necessary Alzheimer-related resources.

The likely data sources include medical websites that contain detailed information regarding Alzheimer's Disease.  We would also need mental challenge games or quizzes we can link to the user.  Our data sources also include the users' geolocation and user input for our potential memory quizzes.
